# COS 730 - Assignment 3
# eBay Legacy System

### Overview
eBay is an online marketplace that was founded by Pierre Omidyar during September of 1995.
Formely known as "Auction Web", it was created to allow users from all around the world to sell and buy items through auctions from each other. Today eBay accomodates roughly 162 million users and 25 million sellers with 800 million items listed and 11 600 employees. 

### Improvements
- #### None Fungible Tokens 
The world has transitioned from merely owning physical items, virtual items can be owned too. For example you could own a picture on the internet, or virtual property. Non Fungible Tokens are is a digital asset that is stored and managed on the blockchain,
but unlike fungible tokens such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are not changeable
and are unique. This will allow eBay to dominate both the physical and digital market.
In this application, I will provide and demonstrate a working prototype of this feature.

- #### Wallet integration
Because of the decentralised nature of NFT’s, it only makes sense to facilitate payment for them using decentralised networks and architecture. The other improvement that I have proposed to the eBay legacy system is the expansion of payment methods into crypto currencies such as Eutheruem and Bitcoin. This will allow people to fully utilise the digital market, with digital currencies and fully compete with other digital markets such as openSea. This will also improve security with regards to payment as it will be integrated with the blockchain and people's personal wallets, which eliminates the use of sending sensitive information such as credit card information on the application.
